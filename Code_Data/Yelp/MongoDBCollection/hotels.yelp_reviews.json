    "review_text" : "i have mixed feelings about changi village. on the one hand, the location is great, in a nice quiet neighborhood with tons of restaurants and a very large hawker center right next door. on the other hand, it's not quite as close to the airport as i had expected. it took 20 minutes to get there from the airport on a friday at mid-afternoon. it did only take about 15 minutes before dawn on saturday morning, though, so that wasn't too bad. in general, i thought the hotel was nicely decorated and comfortable. the rooftop infinity pool is great for a swim, although there aren't a ton of lounge chairs - and they are very close to the pool, so it's a little splashy. my room was also nicely decorated and well appointed, with laminate wood flooring, a nice large bathroom, and a huge closet where you could hide your suitcase away. however, the bed was extremely hard and uncomfortable (and i like a firm mattress), and the water in the shower was cold in the pre-dawn hours. as my room faced the hotel atrium, there was also a lot of noise from kids running around, etc. i would definitely ask for a non-atrium facing room if you stay here. overall, if you need a place to stay on a layover that's near the airport and lets you still experience the great singapore food culture without going into the city, this is probably as good as you'll do. i only wish that the beds were more comfy!",

    "review_text" : "i'm not normally an airport hotel kind of fan but my flight departs from sin very early in the am  so i elected to grab a room here and save myself the pain of a long cab ride in tomorrow morning. for an airport hotel, this is a really nice effort that takes the pain out of a quick layover or being in transit. first, it is very convenient to an mrt station so you can escape as needed to the city if you want. next, it is attached pretty much to terminal 3 so you can walk right into the lobby if you are at that terminal. otherwise, the inter-terminal trains make it quite easy to get here from the other terminals. finally, despite being fairly busy and having to cater to all different types of travelers (tour groups, families, single business, grumpy bumped passengers, etc.) the service here is really great. i opted to pay the additional fee for access to the executive lounge figuring that would be my meal for the evening and it was very worth it. they put out a nice spread for the evening with plenty of variety. the attendants in the lounge were incredibly courteous, hard-working and polite and not in a patronizing way. that is the kind of service you cannot train into people. kudos to this place and these employees for being a great face for the hotel to the customer.  the look of this property is a cool mix of modern architecture and some asian influences including covered walkways surrounded by water and native plants and rooms that have external entrances to open-air walkways. many of the rooms have some great views of the airport and the planes moving about. the rooms are fairly hip, bright and cheery with light colored bedding, lots of glass and light and with rainfall showers. really nothing to complain about. of course, there are cheaper places to stay and in the end, it is still an island oasis surrounded by an airport hence i'm keeping it at 4 stars but as a airport hotel, it delivers much more than is necessary.",

    "review_text" : "hello from the travelerintransit. i promised a report on my weekend staycation at crowne plaza changi airport so here it is! honestly the weekend flew by so quickly because s and i were both feeling so relaxed in the tropical resort environment of the hotel and before i knew it we had to check out. bah. anyway take a look at what crowne plaza has to offer! and really, it's the best transit hotel ever.crowne plaza changi airport takes on a contemporary asia theme which focuses a lot on the tropics. there are plenty of open and green spaces which remove all that strain from traveling (and work in our case). i couldn't believe we were in an airport hotel when i stepped into our 75sqm king suite. boy the space was huge. love the huge windows that allow natural light to flood the room in the day.i love the soothing colors of the room and it's really similar to the new leather upholstery of my favorite carrier singapore airlines. the typical deluxe rooms are 36sqm and all rooms come with a 1.8m work desk and an ipod docking station. the rooms function equally as a space to rest and recuperate or as a working space for the travelling executive. the difference with the suite is that there's an additional living area, everything else is the same. i cannot believe that all the rooms come equipped with a bathtub. that's sheer luxury for city hotels and it's big enough for 2! wink wink. love the refreshing citrusy scent of the bath products from the white company. all your toiletries needs would be accommodated.we also had pool access from our bedroom and it walks straight out to the 30m landscaped outdoor swimming pool. the crowne plaza club which is created exclusively for frequent business travelers with their personalized service and host of special privileges and amenities available daily from 6.30am to 11pm. there are internet workstation and meeting rooms for booking, as well as photocopying and faxing facilities. complimentary wifi access is also available.all day coffee, tea, juices, mineral water, soft drinks and a selection of cookies are available. another club perk is the daily evening drinks and canapes from 5.30 to 7.30pm. they have my favorite wensleydale cranberry cheese! mini sandwiches, puffs and dim sum, along with artisan toast and cheese and a good selection of desserts, you hardly need to eat after.  the club also serves breakfast daily from 6.30am to 10.30am. the spread in the lounge is probably not as great as that at azur (where we could have eaten breakfast at) but it's quieter at the lounge and certainly more relaxing with the pool view.",

    "review_text" : "wow! the schnaziest hotel i have ever stayed at! definitely five star hotel. if you had to choose between eating breakfast here or dinner, i would say stick to breakfast, you won't regret it!my family and i got two rooms at the crowne for a night while we were waiting in transit and all i could keep telling myself is that i didn't want to leave. as we started our ascent to our rooms, we boarded the elevator and i was already laughing at how drowsy i was. the elevator requires you to scan your room key to go to the floor of your room. i did not realize until i opened my sleep deprived eyes a little bigger to see the scanner under the floor buttons. once on our floor, my sisters and i walked, and walked, and walked all the way to the end of our hallway where our room was. let me just say that the hotel rooms were amazing. when we enetered into our room, the a/c was already nice and turned on and room service was already placing the third bed into our room. talk about quick! the beds were so comfortable  (though the pillow covers smelled a little off to me...that didn't matter much).we did not go out of the hotel since we were only staying the night which was okay since this hotel seems to have almost everything. they have a gym (which unfortunately i did not go to see), the pool looked so pretty (but i did not go for a dip since i was too tired to) and they also have a bar located across from azur (the hotel restaurant) which looked pretty lounge-y (though no one was in there much of the time we were here). the restaurant, azur, was your typical, yet upgraded to fancy, hotel buffet. my family and i went to eat dinner around 8 p.m. and a lot of the platters were disappointingly almost empty or completely empty. they had a nice large selection from cod, to roast beef, seasonal veggies!, indian, chinese, japanese food, german sausages (meh) and my favorite, the starches (aka italian, aka pasta! + potatoes)! i did not travel to the raw seafood selection at all after taking a quick pic, good looking as their set up was, i could not stomach looking at any raw shellfish at all at the moment. i loved the mashed potatoes the best, and the miso chicken probably comes in second followed by the satay chicken in third. i am not accustomed to such fancy hotel buffets, so when i went over to the pastas, i did not know that a chef was going to come out to heat the pastas up in the sauce of my choice, i had assumed that it was a self serve thing, (what was i supposed to expect, since nobody was behind the counters!). i got some rotini with their alfredo sauce and a few pieces of the spinach ravioli that they had. not amazing pasta, but okay. i have to say though, other than the three stated above (potatoes, miso chicken and satay), the salad is probably your best bet on avoiding the complete and totally mind stabbing grease headache/stomach ripping nausea that i had receieved right after stuffing my face here. i don't know if it was because i ate way too much? or the food was a little off. i think dessert deserves a section of its own, wouldn't you agree? they had the cutest little dessert things ever, though that's all they were good for, their looks, taste.....ehh, that's a complete different story. after sampling their green tea whatever in the little glass cups, the blueberry cheesecake thing in the little porcelain spoon?, their fruit tart, the green tea tiramisu, and the ice cream?, i think i would have been very much more satisfied if i had just stuck to simple ice cream and almonds. the rest is insignificant in my taste opinion, but my eyes were definitely excited when i saw the desserts (what a trap!). their ice cream freezer had four tubs of ice cream; vanilla, chocolate chili raspberry?, jackfruit, and my favorite flavor of the night, blueberry muffin! the next morning, we came for the breakfast, and i am one to love breakfast. this was a much better buffet in terms of taste than dinner! there's an egg station, chinese, indian, some singapore breakfast noodles, salads, fruits, cereals, juices, and your typical hash browns and sausage section. i loved everything at breakfast! so delicious!!!!! nothing was disgusting, though the radish cakes were super thick, much thicker than i am used to, but like i said, nothing was disgusting! two thumbs up for breakfast.overall, dining here was a good experience. the woman at the front during the dinner service could have been a little nicer, but hey, i return the energy you give me lady. the dining room is always going to be super empty so it doesn't matter when you go (except breakfast, that was pretty good in terms of looking like a busy restaurant). i think i would give the appearance an a, the staff a b and the taste borders a b/b-, averging out my score to a b",

(well, except breakfast, which is very good!).  also be aware, that unlike europe it is much more like the us, the price listed does not include gst and service charges which add 17% to the prices.",

    "review_text" : "the size of the rooms of this hotel is pretty good for a city / state like singapore, where space is at premium. the amenities in the room such as bath robe, tooth brush / paste, comb, give a sense of class. the bed is of good size and comfortable.  the breakfast restaurant is well stoked. it serves a nice variety of oriental dishes, as well as the standard western ones.  it seems to have a fix number of dishes which it rotates. i know since i stayed at this hotel twice; each time over 2 weeks. the hotel is connected to the novena mrt (singapore subway) station. the pathway also leads to the basement of the novena square shopping center which has many good restaurants as well as a decent food court.my complains about this hotel are: 1- the wifi speed is absolutely unacceptable. it is so slow.  i gave up using it. 2- there is no electrical outlet for my electric razor in the bathroom. there is a small mirror near the desk which does have a few electrical outlets. but i must sit down at the desk to shave.in spite of these issues, i will likely stay at this hotel again if i have a chance to return to singapore. but there is also a new hotel being built nearby, which i may want to try too.",

    "review_text" : "i like boutique hotels. you know, the ones that have interesting interiors and a bit of quirk to set them apart from the box-in-the-sky hotels that one finds in every city around the world. oasia is a little in-between the two. it's big with 25 floors and has all the amenities expected of a larger hotel - the gym, sauna, restaurant, room service and a huge outdoor pool with lounges. but there's enough personality to make you forget that you're one of hundreds of people staying here.like what you ask? well it starts with the warm welcome when you pull up in a cab -  the concierge staff are delightful and will make small talk with you as you wait for cabs and will ask how your day was when returning each evening. next, you'll notice the smell - the oasia has a signature scent that wafts through the lobby. the staff on the check in desk are welcoming and accommodating and two times have upgraded my room to a higher club room (with bath tub!) without me even asking. then there's the rooms themselves that have had enough care given to their layout to make them feel a little boutique - like quality linens, wooden panelling, complimentary mini bar drinks (vitamin water), a desk stocked with magazines and small features like art work and a large rug on the floor. while i do love the beauty of the shophouse conversion hotels that exist in singapore, i'm yet to find one that is quiet enough at night to give me a good night sleep. the oasia for the most part is quiet. my most recent stay had me awake a few times on the first night as a mysterious beeping sound was coming from the hallway. it was fixed the next day, but was annoying on that first night.  i was later told that next time i should specifically request a quiet room (a good tip!). while the oasia may not be in the trendiest area of town, there's a taxi rank downstairs as well as the mrt station which will quickly whisk you across town. for business travel it is a good option.",

(we had a corner room at the end of the hall though!)while i loved the modern and newly remodeled decor, i wasn't a fan of the frosted glass wall behind the bed/shared with the bathroom. my husband always gets up in the middle of the night to use the restroom, and i am the lightest sleeper in the world.....the location right on top of the mrt was great especially because of the terrible weather and haze. however, i'd rather just choose a hotel that is closer and walkable to..well, anything. the hotel is a bit isolated but a great escape for those coming to the medical buildings. the included breakfast was definitely a plus. not too extensive, but decent food and enough to get you going in the morning.",

    "review_text" : "marina bay sands.. one of the most beautiful hotels/casino i have ever seen. this place really gives 5 star hotels a new meaning. right when you see it from the outside, you will be in awe by the beautiful 3 towers plus a huge ship at the top which is also a infinity pool. the great thing about this place is it really tries to make the guests feel important which means if you are not staying at the hotel.. no entry into the pool. the security is great all around but the views, food, and service truly is on another level. even just for one night this place will blow you away by staying there. one of the most amazing things i saw in the casino which blew my mind was a robot going around passing free water and soda.. yes a robot.. the other amazing thing is how diverse and you get people from everywhere staying there. they also have an art and science museum which is a must visit and truly blew my mind as well. if you do stay here, get the rewards card as you get rebates once you come back and it makes a huge difference. you also get 50% off the art and science museum tickets. easily my favorite hotel in the world. yes i said world.",

    "review_text" : "marina bay sands hotel if you plan on traveling to singapore and know you will come here once only, do book yourself a one night stay at this magnificent hotel. you will not regret staying here. a resort, casino, shopping, food, gym, infinity pool, observation deck, central location, what more can you ask for? as we approached tower number 3, our luggage was already taken care. we simply wait in line for check in. even though their check in policy was at 3pm, the guest services let us in early ! high five! we get to enjoy a few more hours at this luxurious place. insert your hotel key into the slot and you will be amaze at what you see. the curtains opens automatically every time you enter your room, so you can be amazed any time of the day of the city view. as hotel guests, we get to enjoy the infinity swimming pool overlooking the horizon starting as early as 6am in the morning. not only is the pool free for guest, the observation deck is too. if your hotel stay includes all of these, i say it's worth the money! at a bit on the higher end of the price point, you guys might question is it worth it? if you plan your day where you want to explore the city and not wanting to be in a resort like environment then i advise you to stay somewhere else. but you if you are want to experience the kind services with a lot amenities and have some pampering time while in singapore, then this hotel is a recommended choice.",

    "review_text" : "i have to admit, i booked this place with a lot of reservation having read very mixed reviews about this hotel from reviews. however given that i could only access the infinity pool as a guest which they actually did enforced very strictly, i decided that it'd be worth splitting or two nights stay in singapore between this place and fullerton bay hotel just so that i can experience having been here! i was so paranoid of not receiving great service that i booked a club level room for our less than 15-hours total stay at this place and i have to say that i'm relieved(!) to have enjoyed every minute of our stay here! the parking drive-in and the lobby was indeed hectic but not overwhelmingly crowded and it did help that we were served at a separate counter. the staff was welcoming, friendly and accommodated to our request (ie. celebrating our honeymoon, late checkout, etc.) and places us in a delightful room with one of the best views of the marina bay and the singapore night lights. the club lounge which closes way too early was booming in the morning but still felt orderly and meticulous and the breakfast in one of the highest point in singapore. now for the pool, despite our concerns, wasn't so crowded or disorderly and actually very well-kept given its grand size. the view was again every bit phenomenal and exactly what i had expected. my only complaint is that the the pool water was a bit cold and hence it was hard to swim or spend long bits of time in the pool. there were also jacuzzis facing the gardens by the bay offering a different and equally intriguing harbor view of singapore, but on a smaller side and crowded for comfort.would i recommend this hotel? oh yes!! sad to say, but this hotel stay was completely overshadowed by our near-perfect stay the subsequent night at the hotel across the waters - fullerton bay hotel. however, the uniqueness of what marina bay sands offered (the grand lobby, the view from the famous infinity pool, observation deck, club lounge, spacious gym, humongous mall connected to the hotel, the casino, easy walkway to nearby attractions, incredible views from the city view rooms, etc.) offered nearly made up for it. the room size, amenities, interior, service, etc also did not lack to much behind other 5 star hotels of similar price/tiers. all in all, i'd say this hotel is very comparable to my experiences with humongous 5-star resorts in las vegas (ie. wynn/encore, aria, etc.) - all very modern, new large-scale hotels with impeccable room amenities and facilities but without a necessary a very, very personalized service.",

    "review_text" : "there are breathtaking parts of the marina bay sands hotel that make it worth it to stay at least one night but i also think some other parts of the hotel is not worth it for a longer stay. without a doubt the infinity pool on the 57th floor is the main attraction and why i wanted to stay at mbs. it overlooks the city of singapore and whether you go up at night to see the fabulous skyline lit up or you go during the day to see all the architecture, it is a truly amazing sight. be aware there will be people there at all hours but it is not impossible to get a photo by yourself along the edge. the pool area is open 6am to 11pm and there are 3 large sections to the pool. the far right area, near tower 3, is adults only.the rooms are mbs are spacious and clean. we got 2 rooms, one with the garden view and one with city. the garden view room has a huge patio area with no furniture. it overlooks the gardens of the bay and it is so beautiful at night!! the city view wasn't bad either. lots of pretty buildings in this bustling city. the amenities in the room are mediocre. for such an expensive hotel, i expected better shampoo/conditioner and other products but it lacked in those areas. the shower in one of our rooms had a slight drainage problem. the beds were comfy but i've slept in better.we had the morning breakfast buffet at rise downstairs and i loved it. it was very affordable and it had so many options. different cultures incorporated in each area: chinese breakfast, japanese, american, omlettes, cereal, etc. i really liked that they made you feel at home no matter where you're from. the food was fresh and flavorful. if you're in a hurry, i highly recommend you just eating at rise for convenience and for a wicked delicious breakfast.",

    "review_text" : "beautiful hotel. somewhat overrated. view  was nice. unfortunately after ordering our drinks we waited an additional 45 minutes before recognizing that we had been forgotten about. the couple next to us received their drinks and hamburgers and finished them before we got anyone's attention. after receiving our waters no one check on us. i was very disappointed for this to be my first time here and to receive service like this. once we got someone's attention on our own, they told us that the bartender forgot to make them. the restaurant greeted us with  complementary glasses of champagne. thank you for that. but to be the classy hotel that you stand out to be i was surprised a manager nor supervisor never came to apologize. with that being said.  the drinks were good. hopefully my next time there i will have a better experience.#moononthego",

    "review_text" : "staying at marina bay sands was a wonderful experience and i'd do it all over again. from checking in to enjoying the amenities, swimming on the 57th floor to exploring the gardens, playing games at the casino to checking out, the experience was well worth it.amongst the three towers, we stayed on the 43rd floor of the 3rd tower, which gave us an amazing view. the room we stayed in was very spacious and had more furniture in it than what i expected. room service was quick and friendly. local calls were free of charge using the room phone. there are room controls for the window blinds and curtains and a good number of outlets for all your charging needs. the bathroom was the only con, as the shower and toilet area was one. the shower water wasn't contained at all and the floor was extremely slippery. there were several drawers and a decent sized closet for clothes plus a safe to store any valuables or things you don't want to carry. the bed and the pillows were very comfortable. overall, a stay that is unforgettable.",

    "review_text" : "the hotel is beautiful, luxurious, and has an amazing view from all floors. it's convenient to the mrt, shopping, quay, etc. etc. etc. i'd recommend anyone to stay here on a first time trip to singapore just to get it out of the way and say you've been to the pool. however, $1000, 2 night stay, for a room with a bathtub in the middle of january where the pool is 40 degrees f and it's raining non-stop... their \"off-peak\" prices need to be cheaper. this is especially true for the room we got. it had an amazing view of the bay and gardens... but the room was underwhelming. i've stayed in much less expensive, still 5-star hotels, with much nicer furnishings... there wasn't even a pillow menu!the hotel and mall also need more dining options, other than room service or pricey meals. there needs to be a fast food option and it was a quest to find a good cup of coffee. lastly, it is so hard to get around the hotel, particularly when coming back from the gardens. there's a whole bunch of doors out on the lobby level but none coming in. we had to walk around the whole hotel coming back from the gardens and we we had to jay walk a few times to get to our uber. not fun in the rain!anyhow, it's a great place to try for a night so you can visit the pool. the pool was smaller than expected but it was still a treat to be in! i recommend coming in the spring when the weather is better. p.s. a highlight was that the casino served free beverages through an automated machine! so cool!",

    "review_text" : "after a 3 week pack packing trip throughout south asia, we thought we'd end this trip with a bang and decided to stay here for one night. it was a steep price to pay, but split between friends the room and the stay was well worth the money. i felt like royalty as i opened the door and walked into the living room. it had floor to ceiling windows that open up to the balcony with a gorgeous view of the super trees. the room was well kept, included 2 bathrooms with a telephone inside each (i guess if youre bored during your business you can call each other and chat?) the king sized bed was comfy, and wifi was very fast. i loved how the curtains open up automatically when you first walk into the room. the concierge brought our bags up after about 10 min and we made our way up to the infamous infinity pool. the sky park was absolutely breathtaking. it gave a panoramic view of singapore, however, there was quite a number of people around. the infinity pool certainly lived up to its hype; its divided into adult section and a kid section in the middle. whoever thought of that idea deserves a medal. its long enough that even with the kids screaming and playing on the other side of the pool its nice and calm in the adult section. it an amazing place to watch the sunset while dipping into the pool and enjoying the amazing service offered by all the staff members. the other side is lined with restaurants and hot tubs and offers a surreal view of the sunrise. its definitely one of the best hotel experience ill ever have. no regrets.",

    "review_text" : "the marina bay sands hotel in singapore is a super incredible (one of a kind) resort. it is located by the marina bay waterfront and easily accessible by train, taxi or bus. this hotel is full of excitement with all the luxury stores and boutiques like louis vuitton- hermes - coach - gucci - rolex and any high end store you can imagine plus more. they had a marvel store and a superhero restaurant with all the statues of the most recognized heroes. yes they did. they have gondola boat rides within the hotel to cross you from one side of the building to another. and how can i forget the pool they have an infinity pool on top of the building, that's correct on the roof. go to my review (sands skypark infinity pool) to see for yourself. amazing structure. the food court and the shopping areas were phenomenal they offered many specialty foods like peking duck and a lot of signature singapore dishes. i saw brand names that were unknown to me that i have never seen even on the posh streets of nyc's shopping district.  this was a shoppers dream to have every luxury clothing and watch brand under one roof this was unbelievable. they had a store that created custom items out of specialty skins like alligator, lizard, ostrich and crocodile. for example they had a custom yellow ostrich golf bag and a men's alligator jacket with a fur lining. this store had every color men's belt in alligator. of course they offered many women bags and purses in all sorts of skins and colors. this was more than a mall and more than a resort this was an exclusive exceptional shopping experience unknown to man. this resort not only offered many exclusive store and restaurants they even had an amazing casino. they have a shopping experience for kids like no other they had an area that provided high end stores for kids. i have never experienced a hotel not even in las vegas that made you ooh and awe so many times. the pool is something out of a fantasy film. the hotel alone is gigantic and made me think of will smith's film \"independence day\" when i first set my eyes on this inconceivable structure. they have so many amenities to enjoy in and around this hotel like the incredible tree light show that happens nightly within walking distance of the hotel. if you visit singapore this is a must visit destination. marina bay sands is simply the best 10 stars would be a slight rating. if you visit singapore \"you gotta shop here\"",

    "review_text" : "i will not take away the fact that this hotel is beautiful, but it is a tourist trap imo. the staple and draw of this hotel is it's infinity pool that sits a top the hotel towers on the 57th floor. i saw what my gf paid for this room for one night and although it was a birthday present, i thought she paid too much. when we arrived you're in awe of the high ceilings, the scents along w/ the hustle and bustle of the people walking past you. we arrived early as we caught a red eye over, so we were hoping to check in early. while standing in line, one of the staff members brought out bottles of juices for those in line. typically it's a small bottle of water, but these were large sized bottles of juices. we were able to check in early and we raced to our room to see just how awesome the room was. we figured for $500 a night the room had to be awesome. unfortunately when we arrived the room was average. the room had a bed, a sofa and a table. the bathroom was a nice size. it offered the typical amenities of shampoo, conditioner, lotion, etc. the fridge was cleared so that we could place our own items in it. the room also had a large balcony, w/ no furniture. we had a view of garden by the bay. the wait for the elevators was a downer. there were several times it took up to 15 minutes to get up/down. we had called down for someone to assist w/ luggage to which it took 45 minutes. he said he had waited for 20 minutes to come up. the hotel's pool, as mentioned, is located on the 57th floor and you need a hotel key to get in/out of the pool area. each person needs to have a room key in order to get in. on the day of checkout, whatever time your checkout is, that's when you need to be out the pool as your key deactivates at that time. they obviously don't want people hanging out up there if they haven't paid for it. the view is amazing at whatever time of day you go. all of the city is on display. you can order food and drinks while up there as well.the hotel offers several places to eat. in addition it has numerous shops. there is a high end mall & casino attached to the hotel. numerous singapore tourist sights are within a 5-10 minute walk/driver. uber is available in singapore and they pick up on either side of the hotel or from the casino.",

    "review_text" : "if ever visiting singapore, for $400-$700 a night you get an opportunity to stay at one of the most unique hotels in the world. recently featured on a netflix series called amazing hotels, its no surprise this place was featured. i stayed here for 3 nights and had a panoramic view of the marina and super tree. there are so many amenities onsite i can't list them here but it is high end. this hotel is basically 3 - 60 story skyscrapers that all connect at the lobby level. on top of the 3 building on the 57th floor is the worlds largest infinity pool. i posted video and pics on my ig page but ran out of memory so i could not post them here. the view is unmatched by any pool i have ever experienced in my life. it offers a panoramic view of the singapore skyline and is breathtaking on a clear day. the pool actually looks like a spaceship landed on top of the buildings from the outside. there is also a high end shopping mall on site as well as a casino. there is a roof top bar next to one end of the pool for folks who want to see the pool but aren't guests at the hotel. i recommend staying here if even for a night. it's an experience that you will remember long after you forget how much you paid to have it!not so humbly submitted,michael c.",

    "review_text" : "marina bay sands .. the name in itself is enough as it must be one of the most sought after places in singapore. right from the iconic infinity pool to the casino, it is one place which makes to the bucket list of most of the people visiting singapore.stayed here for a couple of days and although i was impressed by most of the things yet there seemed to be a bit of gap in service to be vs service offered which is a rarity for a 5* property.the processes are tedious, right from check in to check out .. whether to check in from the main counter or to move to the other side .. there is always some soft of confusion going around. early check ins aren't the thing here and thus a lot of peeps waiting in lobby could be seen. also, i know it is a thing but the sheer number of selfie sticks roaming around in the hotel, right in the lifts to lobby pool to gates, is absolutely silly ..in spite of this little trouble mbs is 100 % a place to feature in your bucket list.so, my room was facing garden's by the bay and it was a great view .. the sea during the day and the music synchronized lighted garden by the night was certainly a view to behold. everything else about the room was great, right from the cleanliness to space to comfort. moving on to the more famous things - the infinity pool, well yeah the view is absolutely breathtaking, the pool is also wonderful but the crowd might be a turn off .. (not to me, i come from india lol), jokes apart the pool is divided in 3 segments and is not a one length infinity pool .. secondly most of the crowd here is for a profile pic .. so a lot of selfie sticks yet again :dso, i recommend to choose your spot and go for the pic :d .. take at least 3 selfie sticks / person to even everyone out :dmight not be real to compare the casino with vegas etc but yeah it is good fun as well. overall, mbs is rightly a must stay place whenever someone is visiting singapore. i would love to come back another day as well.",

    "review_text" : "i enjoyed my stay at this hotel, but it is not worth the price for more than a night or two at most.  i booked two nights here in september 2017.room: our room was fine but nothing over the top as we only booked the standard room.  we checked in very early so we were stuck on the second floor with no view but we weren't in the room much anyway so it was not that big of a deal.  the amenities were great and smelled lovely.  even if we did not use up all of ours the housekeeper was sure to leave more each day which was nice.  the bed was comfortable enough but not outstanding.  there was plenty of room for the two of us.  wifi access throughout the hotel was very good.check in: we arrived around 1am and obviously it was too early even for an early check in.  we could easily valet check our luggage and we went to the casino which is 24 hours to play craps and slots and grab a bite to eat.  we checked back with the front desk around 7am and we were allowed to check in.  that was quite nice of them because it was about 7 hours earlier than normal check in time.check out: if you need to speak to the desk when you check out you had better plan on waiting in line for a long time.  it can take a very long time to check out and every day the lines were very long at check out.  to remedy some of this they do offer a quick check out option where you fill out a small form and drop it in the box in the lobby and they email you a final receipt.  we did not have any special needs for checking out so we thankfully just dropped our card off in the lobby and left.atmosphere: the hotel is very beautiful and clean but it is a tourist trap.  there are always tons of tourists around everywhere you go.  prices are expensive here for almost everything.  it is still fancy regardless of this but it is very busy so you will almost always have lines or lots of people around you.pool:  the pool is nothing short of amazing, regardless of how many people are present.  the view is absolutely worth the stay and if you get there by 6-7am you can get a great spot at the pool.  if you arrive after 7am you will likely not get prime spots as several tourists are up there already for the sunrise photo ops.  the food and drinks are good but pricey, which we expected.  not different from going to a pool in las vegas but not as rowdy.  the service is quick and they were excellent.  there's not much space to sit your belongings around the chairs so if you're close to the pool there is a risk of your items being splashed by children.observation deck: if you stay here at the hotel you can access the observation deck and it is a good place to see the views and watch the fountain show at night if you get an early viewing spot.  great views of the gardens by the bay.complaints: really the only major complaint about this hotel is the elevator situation.  they do not have stairs that you can take to any floors at all.  all stairs have alarms on them so you are forced to wait several minutes at a time for an elevator and you will likely have several stops on your way up.  this was particularly difficult on the day we checked out since we had luggage and there were long lines.  the staff did remedy the situation by opening up their staff elevators and stairs for us to use and even passed out bottles of water on our way down.  the other complaint i have isn't really possible to fix since the hotel is designed to maximize on tourist dollar spend.  there's just so many people around all the time.  it is still very nice but you will feel like you're excluded from the outside world because everything is so luxury and expensive.regardless, i would still stay here for a night again if i ever traveled back to singapore.  the pool deck is just too good to pass up.",

    "review_text" : "i have 3 rooms each an upgraded room cost over $550 a night and i have 2 more nights here. as mentioned by so many reviews here the infinity pool is hands down and should not be missed.  the restaurants are also excellent and have very good quality dishes.  but pricey which is understandable. the reason i rate is 2 stars are:1.  the hotel is \"handicapped unfriendly\" - i am not handicapped myself and i noticed there are no ramps for people who are on wheel chair. another noticeable feature is main entrance to all three towers do not have automatic sliding doors. to enter/exit the hotel one would need to push. can u imagine how an elderly or handicapped person has to grapple with this?  i have never seen a 5-star hotel or even a 3-star hotel without auto closing /opening door!  whoever design the building must have a reason but obviously he/she did not factor in people with disabilities!2.  another issue i have applied to all 3 rooms. the wash basin in the bathroom does not drain easily. obviously the drain trap must be trapped with all junk. i am not able to wash coz if u keep the water running the basin will fill up very quickly.  brought this to hotel attention and a service technician came to fix it while we left the room. but upon returning the problem persist and i do not wish to deal with it again.  i would have expected a hotel of this standing would have ensured everything works impeccable.  3.  the room is spacious but lacks elegance and decor. the king size deluxe room has the basic amenities.  but the bathroom is a disappointment. this particular room does not have a door at the shower area. so if you are to take a shower u bet u will have water entering the \"dry\"zone!4.  wi-fi sucks!  it is very slow.  i suspect the bandwidth is inadequate for the number of users jamming the connection. fortunately i rented my own router in arrival at changi. that said i have some positives worth mentioning.  1. staff are excellent and extremely helpful.  they did go the extra mile to make your stay memorable. 2.  location is perfect. and it faces the singapore river and provides awesome view of the city and waterfront.  would i come back to this hotel?  probably not.  i have experienced the infinity pool and that is the selling point. there are better hotels and offer more competitive price in the area. so if you are going to be in the area and u want to experience the infinity pool then a nights stay is worth it. these are pictures taken from the hotel.",

(#gross #wtf) 9pm, we finally got a call from a manager.  after speaking with the front desk manager, he offered us $200 mbs credit and 3pm late check out.  okay, they try to make up for it. 10pm, my finance opened the mini fridge, and found some empty slots, left over dried up kimchi and grapes in it (pictures attached). #notcoolso this time the front desk manager himself actually came up, apologized again (#poorguy) and moved us to a different room. overall, it's one of the nicest hotel in the world.  you just have to pray there is no more roaches or left over food in the room.fyi, when they tell you 5 minutes, it means 30.",

    "review_text" : "selfie sticks everywhere...... this hotel is one of the most iconic destinations in singapore. i honestly only wanted to stay here because of the rooftop infinity pool and the views were as amazing as expected. while the view was unbeatable from the rooftop, the pool and everywhere else in this hotel is total chaos. think vegas casino but worse since you can easily pay upwards of $500 a night. this is clearly a family vacation type of hotel, not a couples or business hotel by any means. don't expect efficient service or a relaxing atmosphere, even if the prices may suggest so. the hotel didn't live up to the expectations of a 5* hotel... everything from the check-in process to printing our mbs membership cards was a total mess. be prepared to wait at least 30mins to check in, as they don't accommodate early arrivals. because of this, hordes of people just wait around in the lobby, some yelling and screaming. the infinity pool was nice and relaxing... as long as you came the first 30 min it opened before the sun was even up. as soon as there was a glimpse of sunlight, sitting around the pool deck felt like a disney cruise with kids yelling and running in every direction. a total zoo. please have more adults only sections! avoid the yoga class (additional fee) at all costs! so disorganized... we spent 15-20 mins trying to round everyone up before attempting all of 4 yoga positions. horribly poor instruction and such a waste of time. i recommend staying here for just one night just to experience the pool and then switching hotels asap. or just pay the $20 fee to use the pool and leave. luxury hotels in singapore are notoriously cheap so this one isn't worth a long stay.",

    "review_text" : "this hotel was everything i was expecting it be and more. the mbs staff treated us so well and anything we needed they were happy to accommodate. the view of the garden from our room was beautiful, especially at night when the trees would \"dance\" to music. note: if you get the room with the garden view, you get a balcony whereas if you get the city view, you don't. the interior of the hotel kind of reminds me of luxor from las vegas...if luxor were to be renovated and updated. the main reason for our stay there was of course the iconic infinity pool upstairs, which of course did not disappoint. we never had a problem finding lounge chairs by the pool in the afternoon and at night (but then again we vacationed there during the week). p.s. if you get hungry really late at night (after 11pm) and you don't want to leave the hotel vicinity you can go down to the shoppes' food court on the bottom level, and they \"hawkers\" that stay open really late! super yummy!",

    "review_text" : "complete tourist trap and not designed for business travelers at all. lack of conference room or quiet space completely disqualify the place for business setting. we actually had to rent a conference room at other hotel because everywhere in the hotel is so loud.,room is definitely not worth the price...99c store alarm clocks, thin cushion bed, super slow paid wifi, shower handle that keeps slipping and eventually falling off...list goes on. i got non-smoking room but when i got there the room smelled like a dive. i called the front, they wouldn't switch the room and insisted to \"clean the air\". 15 minutes later someone shows up with this industrial size spray that reminded me of bug killer. 20 minutes later my room was foggy with this crazy smell of...death. when i checked in at 2am there was only one person at check in desk, she said there are three people on duty after midnight but one was resting and the other has to man the back office. how many flights land at sin after midnight? many. check out is like the disneyland, long wait for good 20~30 minutes. to me that's just poor management. housekeeping service was excellent and left an elephant made out of towel...also they never took the top left on the desk. breakfast buffet is total rip off, i would not recommend to my worst enemy, poor quality, long wait. fitness center...its huge! and view is awesome. lots of cardio machines and free weights. i got very motivated. pool - 57 floor distinct mbs from any others. the stunning view and and design of the pool is definitely something unique to mbs and singapore. swimmer or not, dipping in the pool and hanging on the edge of 57th floor is really cool experience. i would recommend hitting the pool when it's open at six, or right before closing as they aren't as crazy busy. also do not forget your bathrobe, the front desk said bathrobes are available but that was total lie.  i remember my singaporean friends told me that staying at mbs is once in life time experience, and once was enough for me.",

    "review_text" : "when i think of singapore, i think of amazing hawker centre food, merlion park/statue, and the singapore skyline with the iconic marina bay sands towers in the background.on a recent trip to singapore, staying at the mbs was a must. everything about the mbs is luxurious yet tasteful and did not feel over the top just for the sake of it. upon check-in, we were upgraded to a beautiful orchid suite.the room was over 1,050 square feet and featured a dining area, living room, and a bedroom with access to the balcony. grand bathroom with a tub and one of the biggest walk in showers i've been in. no joke, you can probably fit 12 people in there comfortably. the highlight of the room was the balcony at night overlooking the gardens by the bay. the casino requires a passport for free entry. otherwise, you will have to pay a levy of $100sgd for entry. standard casino with most of your table games and slots. noticed a lot of baccarat and sic bo tables. minimum bets for roulette i believe are $5sgd inside and $20sgd outside. baccarat table mins start at $50sgd. the infinity pool is breathtaking and probably the reason you're staying at the mbs. offering views of merlion park and the singapore skyline as you hang on the side of the 57th floor infinity pool, it is definitely a must. merlion park is accessible from the hotel by taking the helix bridge and walking along the bay. many great outdoor food vendors and even an outdoor auditorium on the walk there. the marina bay sands is not just a hotel but a destination. it is definitely an architectural marvel to be appreciated and equally beautiful near and far.",

    "review_text" : "we only spent a night here but had a great experience. we arrived early (around 10am) and they were able to facilitate an early check in for us. the whole check-in process was quick and easy. the infinite pool is incredible and there are a couple jacuzzis overlooking the garden that are great to relax in (and adult only). a section of the pool was adult only which is really nice when you just want to relax (majority of the pool is family friendly). the staff was great - quick to respond whenever we needed anything and really friendly. the room was really good - spacious, clean (loved the bathroom) and the bed was comfortable. we were only a level 10, but still had a great view.everything is fairly expensive (the room, cocktails, food etc) but that's a given for a 5-star hotel in singapore. cocktails were delicious! free wifi in the rooms which seemed to extend through the attached shopping centre for us and free printing and computer use in the business lounge at the bottom of tower 3 - which was handy to print out our boarding passes for our next flight. all-in-all, we had a great time and will definitely be back next time we're in singapore!",

    "review_text" : "love this place. i've been coming here since they first opened when the shoppes were dusty under construction, the pools were empty, the nearest mrt was almost a mile away and the gardens were littered with cranes. even now with the crowds, i still don't mind. why? because... the rooms are nice, there's high end shopping right next door, the bayfront mrt station is connected, the views are nice (garden or city side), the casino is nice with the 2nd level being smoke free and i have patience for check in and out lines. although my checkin line a few days ago was very short. i don't pay for the butler rooms and i don't have vip status so i'm in line with everyone else, it doesn't bother me. and yes, be aware that your passport is needed to go to the casinos. locals need to pay to get in. in some ways it tries to curb any local gambling problems. there are also drink stations on the floor (at least the second floor that i was on - smoke free zone) with sodas, coffee and milo! if you need pool time then maybe this place isn't for you. they've tried to limit pool access with specific pool cards (instead of room cards) but i can imagine it still being crowded. all in all i like the convenience of this place. you can practically never leave this general vicinity if you didn't want to. and if you do want to leave at least the mrt is just downstairs!",

    "review_text" : "marina bay sands is one of iconic places in singapore. most of my foreign friends recognise this place and would ask me whether is it worth a visit here. well, i would say yes, for walking around and also it's connected to nearby shopping malls and the garden by the park. i won't come here for shopping or meals unless for a special occasion.to be honest, i don't like the design of the rooftop, looks odd when you look for the far, but it's easily recognised as singapore as documentary shows usually show this hotel. stepping inside, it certainly gives you the 5 star hotel feeling especially when you head to the rooftop. i have been there a few times and once at a restaurant, finding it the ambiance to be excellent! good place to hang out to have a drink with your good friends and family, but don't get shock when you receive the bill, it's exorbitant. once in a while it's ok, but not on a regular basis at least for me. overall, i find this to be a decent high class hotel.",

    "review_text" : "if you sign up for a club room, get ready for non stop eating all day.i was here for a staycation, and got a club room. the room itself was amazing, it was on the 37th floor so the view is just what you would imagine it to be. we were planning to chillax there during the day, then head to dinner somewhere else. well as it happened, we never even got to our dinner place. when we checked in, there was drinks and snacks from 2-4pm. we had some drinks and fruit and stuff at the club restaurant. went out for a walk. and then when we came back, it was drinks and canapés from 6-8pm. the canapés were really good, and they had roast chicken. the canapés were tiny little portions of scallops, tofu, mushrooms and other little delicately put together bites of delight. and tons and tons of macarons. french macarons, not the coconut chocolate american ones. i of course i gobbled up no less than 6 of them. not pierre herme standard but definitely not the worst and hey it's free flow i'm super happy with it. guess what else was free flow? champagne! i checked out the label and it's actually real champagne not sparkling wine from california or somewhere not even in france. my glass never got to being half empty because the server kept topping it up. of course there were other beverages - fruit juices, all sorts of beer, tea, coffee etc. so yeah we never got to fulfill our dinner reservation, since we were so full of good food by 8pm. neither did we feel like opening our bottle of moet later that night, because we were already full of champagne. we ended up swimming at the infinity pool, which was very very crowded with people taking selfies (and of course we added to the crowd of people taking selfies cuz infinity pool yeah). the service there was great though, fresh fluffy towers dished out whenever you need them. felt like a total hedonist by the end of the day.",

    "review_text" : "we stayed at the marina bay sands in nov. 2013 for a couple of nights before heading out the maldives.  the hotel is very long and narrow but nicely designed.  the rooms have amazing views and are also very spacious. there is a casino in there that required passport for foreigners and a fee for residents.  no photos are allowed in the casino.the food court is very nice in the sense of variety of cuisines but if you get there during lunch hour it can get extremely chaotic.  the amount of people in line and tables are insane.  we have the luxury of having personal space here in the usa, not so much in asia.  it gets really hot in there as well, so if you are able to sit closer to the ice skating ring, that would be the best seat on the house.  or just get there a little earlier.we tried one of the buffet restaurants in the lobby area. (the one closer to the middle of the lobby. they had some interesting items but nothing that stood out.  the most captivating thing about the marina bay sands is the pool floating on top of this three towers.  we wanted to shoot some nice photos before it got crowded so we got there about 5:30 am to watch the sunrise.  it was beautiful!the pool itself is a bit shallow and narrow, mainly to chill/cool off from the heat.but it gives you a rush being up there on the edge of this pool looking down at the city below.  gorgeous views!  this hotel is a bit too touristy for me, there are a million people everywhere.  you gotta walk a bit to get to the food court and stores.  i prefer the boutique type hotels that are more catered to smaller crowds but this was definitely an unique hotel that you must visit while in singapore!",

    "review_text" : "was pretty excited to see that yelp worked in singapore! as i've spent the past couple of months traveling everywhere, i noticed how small of a presence yelp has in the world and that definitely needs to change! so, i'm going to try to review most places outside the us.i finally made it to marina bay sands weeeeeeeeee! in short,infinity pool - 5 starshotel room - 3 starsi randomly decide on tuesday that i'm going to go to singapore the next day so i look up mbs, and they're all sold out except friday night, so you should prob book in advance. turns out, it was a good thing that they only had one night available because one night for a standard room costs $500 usd. but i mean you have to pay it if you want to visit the infinity pool, since outside visitors are not allowed.anyways, the infinity pool was gorgeous with a gorgeous view. however, i might add that it has the perfect view of the business district, and so pretty much my client's building was right there in front of me as i was trying to relax.other than the infinity pool though, the hotel isn't really anything worthy. the rooms are rather dull for being so ridiculously expensive. the hotel is huge and filled with tourists roaming in and out of the casinos (which are huge btw), shopping, and other attractions in the area (gardens by the bay, singapore flyer, etc.) and therefore doesn't make for the coziest of stays.",

    "review_text" : "this hotel costs quite a bit but it's a once in a lifetime kind of opportunity.  four of us were travelling and we got two grand club rooms, one on the garden side and one on the city side both rooms had their benefits.  the garden club room was spacious beautiful, well appointed and had a roomy balcony overlooking the gardens.  the city club room was spacious, beautiful, well appointed and had a view of the city and the nightly water show.  we stayed at this hotel for one reason and one reason only, the pool.  the infinity pool is the tallest outdoor pool in the world and overlooks the city, it is truly spectacular.  this would have been enough for us, but club 55 was impressive as well.  club 55 is the private restaurant/lounge on the 55th floor that serves complimentary, breakfast, tea and evening cocktails for guests staying in a club room or a suite.  i'm not one of those people who likes buffets, i find that picking over food that someone else just hovered over a little unsavory, but this was an entirely different experience.  i mean it was still a buffet, but it was so well-appointed and so well looked after by staff that the food was fresh and inviting.  the hostess who took us to our table was very sweet and the servers were always friendly and chatty (if you wanted them to be).  it was an unforgettable experience.",

    "review_text" : "i have stayed here many times and i get to discover new things during each stay. that is probably the good thing as the first time i stayed or saw the hotel room, i was sorely disappointed. it was not what i expected, definitely not in the league of ritz carlton. review based on at least 10 stays since it opened:room size varies according to the towers and floor levels. most or all deluxe rooms are in tower 3 which is the basic room. it has no bathtub, just a standing shower. bathtubs are only available for premier rooms and above (tower 1 and 2). club rooms are in tower 2. grand club room has more amenities (e.g. bathtub rack, loofah, bath lily, bath salt, shaving kit, mouthwash, talc and bigger sized bath products). some rooms have sofa beds and some rooms are smaller and the reduced bath room size means the bathtub and shower are together. luck of the draw on the day you check in. the bad:- check in can be a horror as it took over an hour when it first opened. (it is a breeze if you are a vip member) - minibar items will be charged once removed, so you cannot store your own drinks or baby milk in it. alternatively, ask for an ice bucket for baby milk to keep cool.- quite a hassle to bring the skypark pool white card to exchange for the entry wristband- very sensitive keycard, it gets de-magnetized when placed next to phone.the so-so:- not a luxurious place (deluxe room, club room, grand club room, premier room) for its price and location.- pretty plain/basic decor- towels seemed to be smaller now compared to when it first opened. regular bath towel size, not bath sheet.the good:- service is excellent, prompt in bringing requested items or when there is a problem with the bath/shower or room.- twg tea and robert timms coffee, nespresso in club/suite rooms- dvd player in grand club room- balcony for most rooms facing the gardens/seait is quite a self-contained place so you don't really have to travel out for food, nightlife or entertainment and shopping. you could time your stay with a visit to the artscience museum, or take in a show at the theater or party all night at the club before crashing in the room. there is always the infinity pool at the skypark, but it gets so crowded in the afternoon that i usually head there in the early morning when it is quieter. but the water can be chilly. there are also yoga classes (3 per day, extra cost) in the gym. or you can get some exercise in the gym. quiet in the afternoon. banyan tree spa is another option for an afternoon of spa treat. note:there are smoking rooms, so be sure to ask for non-smoking rooms if you do not want the room to reek of smoke.",

    "review_text" : "this place is massive! there's a hotel, a casino, and a gigantic shopping mall all connected on the same property. although it is huge, luxurious, and impressively appointed with a gorgeous rooftop infinity pool, it is definitely lack luster on the service side. the rooms are gorgeous but it seems like they rushed themselves when building them because nothing was right. from our bedroom, there was no direct access to the bathroom so in order to do so, we had to walk through the hallway, all around the living room and curve around to the other hallway before we could get to the bathroom. this is quite a trek in the middle of the night.  it would seem that they could have easily resolved this problem by putting another door in the wall from the bedroom connecting to the bathroom. :/regardless of what you ask for, every staff member will be able to find the most pleasant and friendly way to say no to you with a smile. nothing you ask for will be fulfilled. but you won't be mad while they're saying no to you because they do it in such a way that makes you feel all giddy inside. but after they walk away, you'll instantly come back to reality and all of a sudden you're like, \"heyyyy. wait a minute...\" but i guess they don't really need to focus on service because people still come en masse regardless.",

    "review_text" : "this was our third stay at marina bay sands, so i think i have built a good understanding on the hotel and what i expect from it.some of the reviewers clearly have a chip on their shoulder, so keep an open mind when looking for a singaporean hotel.being that this was our third stay, i think some of the shock and awe factor had started to dissipate so i started to notice flaws that i find either unacceptable or very disappointing.first the negatives:- long waits for club tables, if you have the club room you have buffets included (which are good), but you have to line up to make use of these facilities. on 21 dec canapés, we had to line up outside for 28 minutes with our children, which was completely unacceptable.- wearing wrist bands on sky deck and having to carry punch card. previously to get to breakfast or the pool, you simply showed your room card, now you have to bring a flimsy piece of cardboard per guest and get it hole punched, then you get a wrist band like your a 15 year old at the local pools. i found this procedure to take the polish of a luxury hotel experience and down right annoying. god forbid you forget the piece of cardboard they give you at check in to get punched, as we witnessed many poor souls who threw theirs in the bin to be rejected fr entering the roof area. we were not told in the vip lounge what this was for, and we almost ditched ours too. i'm not sure why you can't just show your room card, which security could scan...- sands rewards card not having points credited. i never would have though getting rewards points would be so difficult. since my first trip here, we have tried to get a rewards card, but failed miserably. originally i received a member type number and had to get the physical card on check in, but concierge had no idea about it. i then tried to get my fiends rooms value credited to my account as i booked his room and he has no problem with it, although management certainly did. on his third trip i thought i would try and get the card again, but after visiting three rewards counters to be pinballed to each one i finally admitted defeat, and scrapped three holidays and numerous purchases worth of points.- s300 payment for stroller if damaged, we utilized a hotel stroller for my daughter only to find out there was a $300 payment if damaged, for starters it would cost $130 sgd brand new (if that), and it was old, dirty and falling apart.- no fire alarm in room. it appears safety is not a concern as our fire alarm had been removed, that could have been disasterous. - photographer in pool costs s30. the poolside photographer slams you with a $30 charge for one photograph, which was taken on a small point and shoot camera, a large rip-off.- pool temp is cold. the pool is basically freezing all day, so unless you plan on cutting laps, bring a wet suit.- sky on 57 age restriction is 8+. after trying to have dinner at sky on 57 with my children i was disgusted to learn that my daughter was not allowed in because of her age. we have taken our children to 90% of the fine dining scene in perth, so they are well heeled on that area.- wifi doesn't extend into shoppes very well, and drops out in room. even after a supposed upgrade the wifi dropped out in our room consistently and throughout the complex. i must have re-connected to the wifi two hundred times in 7 daysnow for the positives:- service is very helpful when asked. the service generally was very good, with the staff always looking to help you with any problem no matter how small. the best was situated in the club. we had a staff member named lovely that was so personable and helpful my shy daughter adored her and drew some pictures for her. this was probably the high light of our trip, so well done to the club staff.- shopping is eclectic. if you want a varied shopping experience this is the place. everything from chocolate to lamb leather louis vuitton shoes. the prices are exactly what you expect in singapore so no hidden surprises here, and the service appears a little more polished throughout. - pool has stunning view. the pool is an experience in itself if you don't mind cold water and large crowds. the view and infinity design gives it a great angle on how to swim.- well positioned with smrt. the public transport is right in the heart of the complex, so commuting via smrt is very easy.overall marina bay sands has left us thinking we wouldn't come back again on our next trip to singapore, as other hotels are receiving much more favorable reviews. all the little negatives has built up to really put us off coming back, and it almost feels like a personal attack, because when you fly your entire family from another country and spend a lot of money to be dissatisfied it feels like you have been robbed.if you have not stayed here before i recommend visiting, although i'm not sure about repeat customers being forged, even though it was our third stay.",

    "review_text" : "the marina bay sands hotel experience can be summarised with a terrible metaphor i thought of while looking at my suite's room service menu and spotted mi goreng on there priced at s$28. it's probably pretty good mi goreng, and i'm sure the presentation would be exquisit -- but it is really worth it? probably not. same with the mbs.i stayed in the orchid suite at the mbs for three nights while i was on a quick vacation in singapore, and while i was definitely amazed with the incredible architecture of the building, that's about as far as my amazement went. if you want a high society personalised experience, or you are used to boutique hotels, regardless of how much you pay the mbs will *not* deliver. you most definitely feel like a sheep in the pack at the mbs with its over 2000 rooms and swarm of tourists and businesspeople coming and going every day.let's break it down:~ infinity poolnice. i guess. definitely worth a look at, and you really need to stay in the mbs in order to view the infinity pool and have a little swim. the top floors can get ridiculously windy though, so make sure you're wearing a tight hat or have your hair tied up. the pool is usually freezing, and you have to get up there pretty early in order to reserve some seats.sadly, it became obvious to me that hotel management realize the extent of their exceptional pool and are using this as their money making foundation: the pool is all the hotel really has going for it, and the rest of the hotel is pretty disappointing in most other respects.also, i'm not sure what other reviewers are talking about with regards to a special \"pool card\" or \"wristband\" for the pool. i visited in january 2014 and there was nothing like this -- just scan your room key and you will be granted entry.~ roomthe orchid suite was of a high quality as you would expect. the master bedroom is set apart from the living room in the spacious 97m^2 area, automated curtains, multiple air conditioners, in-room coffee maker and tea facilities, lovely lounge suite. the only significant downside was that there was no separate check in area for this suite, and the queue in the lobby can be quite significant at peak times.if you decide to stay here, be careful of the mini bar -- it is weight sensitive and not complimentary, so if you live a drink out of its holder, even for a second, you will be charged for the beverage. this also means that you can't really store your own beverages or food in the mini bar refrigerator. note that i have read people complaining about noise on the lower levels. the mbs is essentially surrounded by freeways, and even though the glass is double glazed, you can hear the noise of cars at night time. if you're a light sleeper and you get a low level room, request to be moved higher.~ breakfastterrible for th eprice. i don't recommend you get the buffer breakfast unless it is included as a part of your room.the suite featured complimentary breakfast at \"sky on 57\", the restaurant next to the infinity pool on the top level of the mbs towers. how was it? disappointing. a few days later i stayed at the mandarin oriental a short walk fro the mbs, and the breakfast there was incomparably better. like, not even close to what the mbs offered.the buffet selection was smaller, not replenished frequently enough, the staff were too \"buzzy\" around you and simultaneously always looking the other way whenever you wanted another coffee, and the tables were situated far too close to each other, to the extent that i was almost dreading going up to breakfast because i knew that whoever was sitting next to me would be listening to my entire conversation.[a note if mbs management read this: \"naveen\" at the \"sky on 57\" was an excellent host. \"rani\" had a very negative attitude. \"yue ming\" forgot about my order for apple juice. twice.]~shoppesthe shoppes at mbs were incredible. high fashion, high prices, gondolas floating along the river down the middle -- incredible! i recommend you pause your shopping spree briefly in order to stopp of at twg situated over the water and enjoy a nice cup of tea and a delicious cake. the food court down the end near the ice rink has a diverse selection of cheaper food, too.~ overall experienceoverall, the mbs is a world known establishment due to its incredible pool and unique design. if you're in singapore and you have the means, it is probably worth staying here for one night in order to try it out and at least be able to say that you've stayed there. any time longer and you're probably wasting your money -- check out the mandarin oriental a few doors down for absolutely incredible service and facilities at around the same price. just remember that the mba is a tourist attraction first and foremost, and a hotel secondary.",

    "review_text" : "recently took a trip to singapore where i was able to stay at the marina bay sands hotel. the place itself is massive, as there are three large towers that make up the main living spaces of the hotel. everything is nice and modern, as the place just opened a few years ago.while the hotel was nice, you have to know that this place is a huge tourist attraction (and with good reason given what they have to offer). however being a huge tourist attraction, this does come with its limitations. it's always crowded here all the time, and there are so many people hustling about at what seems to be all hours of the day. it's not exactly a quiet place to be, and since there are so many people, it's not very relaxing either...so just keep that thought in mind should you choose to stay here. the hotel is also attached to the marina bay sands shoppes and the casino nearby here too.checking in and out was relatively simple, but also keep in mind that there can be long lines because of the number of guests that stay at this hotel. the magnitude of it all also makes everything feel a little bit less personal when you are dealing with staff as you just become one out of the many people they have staying here. the rooms themselves are quite nice and kept clean, which made for a pleasant experience. they have modern bathrooms, which means they use a sliding door without a lock, and their shower stall has no door but just a piece of glass to keep the water from leaking out. overall the design of the bathroom and of the room was nice though. since singapore is a humid and hot country, i would have liked the air conditioning to be a bit stronger, as i felt as though it got stuffy in the room at times even though we were just a party of two.perhaps the most stunning feature of this hotel is the infinity pool that many have talked about and that is reserved exclusively for hotel guests to control the crowds. it's definitely the number-one \"must see\" of this hotel. you get amazing views of the singapore skyline from the 57th floor of mbs that you just can't get anywhere else. it's a bit of a trek to get here though. our room was on the 31st floor, and to get to the 57th floor you had to change elevators on the 34th floor, which was rather inconvenient at times. i would also recommend going to the pool during the day and night to check out the different views they have.speaking of elevators, i guess since there are so many floors here, they make the elevators travel up and down really fast, and this made me dizzy at times. overall, pretty cool place to check out, but really just to see the infinity pool. if you're looking for a more peaceful place to relax and rest, i would suggest just staying here one night to check out the pool and then going to some other hotel in the area where you can get some peace.",

    "review_text" : "mbs is your standard (albeit very nice) 5-star hotel. i stayed here for about a week when i first came back to singapore. tower 1 and 2 are better than tower 3. the check-in is often crowded and hectic.i really like their spacious rooms and bathrooms with a separate bathtub and shower. another plus is the infinity pool - whenever i stay at mbs i will go on random weekday afternoons and it's always pretty empty... on a couple of occasions staff even offered me cucumber slices for my eyes as i lay back and sipped on my iced lemon tea.. ahhh heaven! the only reason i give it 3 stars is the price... it's a very standard 5-star hotel and i think its popularity is due to the casino... as such, the front desk etc. is often crowded and noisy. i would say that apart from the infinity pool and big rooms, there is nothing much that sets it apart from other 5-star hotels.  finally if you stay here, it's a good opportunity to check out the celebrity restaurants such as sky on 57 (if you're on a \"budget\") or guy savoy (if you want to splurge).",

    "review_text" : "what can i say when two consecutive visits all yield the same results  ... a perfect vacation.first the hotel: i had the pleasure of staying here and experiencing two different types of rooms.  the first visit i stayed in the normal deluxe room with two beds.  we were facing the ocean and had the garden view, which was also blessed with a very decent-sized balcony.  the view was lovely and i really enjoyed the space we had to move around in the balcony area.  the room itself was nicely appointed and had plenty of space for two.  the best part of the room was undoubtedly the bed - which was one of the most comfortable beds i ever slept on in any hotel around the world.  not sure if it's the combination of comfy sheets, a cushy mattress and solid climate control but i slept extremely well the whole time.  the bathroom was fine, and the tub was also shaped comfortably - so i definitely recommend taking a warm bath while you're here.on my second (and most recent) visit - we were able to stay in a club room facing the city/merlion.  the room did not have a balcony but was much bigger than a deluxe room and had a nice living/seating area in addition to a lovely (and equally comfortable) king sized bed.  the tub was just as nice and the shower worked just fine.  my only minor gripe was that the water never really got very hot, but given how warm sgp is you probably won't mind it for the most part.  the bath water however, was perfectly hot.in terms of food options - i did mostly the morning buffet options at the restaurants downstairs and also the private club area on the roof by the infinity pool.  the food is above-average buffet fare and will easily satisfy your needs.  hard to say what really stood out beyond the fact it was just a generally pleasant experience.  my real highlight is the infinity pool - it really does kick ass every time i come here.  i spend probably the most of my time here.  don't take my word for it, just google \"infinity pool\" and behold the awesomeness.  even a snooty new yorker like me has to acknowledge this!as for the rest - let's start with the casino:the size of the casino floor was pretty large.  it's not nearly as big as say, the cavernous floor of the venetian in macau, but it still was reasonably sized and had a non smoking upper floor for players who don't want to inhale all the smoke from downstairs.  bear in mind, while the smell of cigarettes are still overwhelming (it seems everyone smokes in asia, even the cats and dogs) - it's still not nearly as bad as some of the places in macau, which are just plain disgusting.  as usual, the antes here are fairly high (and much higher than most u.s. casinos) and the table games favor asian preferences (baccarat, roulette, sic bo, etc.).  there's also plenty of slot machines to go around as well.as for the mall:gigantic mall with no pretensions about what it is - this is designed to milk every last dime from every affluent tourist from china and elsewhere that shows up ready to throw their money away at lv bags and other insanely expensive reminders of how wealthy they are.  the mall is huge - and your feet will get sore if you want to cover every square inch of this place - kind of ironic given how relatively small singapore is compared to say, the u.s. or china per say lol.  nevertheless, you'll notice every store is virtually empty most of the time and that most people congregate at the food court in the basement level or the outdoor plaza where an occasional (but regular) water show happens at night.  the food court is decent - it won't replace what you get at the best hawker centers in town, but if you're too lazy to get out of the hotel or if you don't want to risk the odd chance you'll get violent diarrhea from eating street food - this place will do fine.  just be prepared to pay nearly double for the same chicken rice or laksa here compared to the hawker centers.  but hey - if you factor in taking the mrt or cabs to another spot - you're ultimately paying about the same money anyway.all in all this place still ranks as one of my favorite places in asia to stay and visit.  it's not cheap, but you get what you pay for.as for the vegas comparisons - this place does not lack versus similar high-end casino hotels like the wynn.  besides, next time try staying at a shithole like the luxor then try staying at mbs.  it's like comparing supermarket ugly with a supermodel.",

    "review_text" : "due to a business trip, i stayed here for four nights and regretted every single one. as one previous reviewer stated, this is a tourist destination. basically you should just show up, take your pictures (and maybe a selfie or two) then leave.yes, the architecture is inspiring and the infinity pool is amazing, but that's pretty much all the hotel has going for it. it's almost as if hotel management is just coasting on these foundations and is absolutely lazy on everything else.case in point...when you first walk in, you see the impressive lobby and think, \"wow!\" then you queue up in the check-in line like cattle and are then subjected to an incessant cacophony of noise bouncing around the walls of the cavernous lobby. to make matters worse, elevator music is piped in and it competes with the string quartet (quintet?) playing in the middle of the room. when you add the buzzing from bus loads of tourists, it all creates a crazy soundtrack that says, well the exact opposite of world-class ambience.the pool is also overrated. in the evenings, the area is crowded and messy with strewn towels and robes on every chair. when i first arrived, there were lots of kids screaming and splashing. as the evening progressed let's just say more adult play became evident. i also felt grimy after my swim. it was as if my skin was covered in a sticky residue, and i couldn't wait to shower it off.i also had some issues with the on-site restaurants. at rise, i asked for a table for one and was promptly seated in an isolated corner tucked out of sight. when a group of austrian or swiss tourists came my way and wanted to sit in my section, the following conversation occurred:manager: \"oh no, only locals sit here.\"lead tourist: \"oh, well i wanted a bigger table anyway.\" (ambles off)me: \"i'm not a local.\"manager (turns around): \"what?\"me: \"i'm not a local. is that why you put me here?\"manager: \"oh no miss, we don't discriminate in singapore.\"me (raises eyebrow): \"oh, i think you just did.\"manager (embarrassed babbling commences)me: (interrupts) \"check please.\"for breakfast, i tried out another restaurant and apparently gave the wrong room number for the bill. (i guess that's what happens when you work overnight until 5:30 a.m.) anyway, another manager bustled over with a lot of sighing and annoyed looks because apparently i was too dumb to remember my room number and she had to look me up in the system. when i said thanks for her trouble and good-bye, she ignored me and walked away.there were even issues checking out. once again, i was confronted with a herd of humanity, but this time a hotel employee was walking up and down the lines offering to check people out with his ipad. i can see the intent was good, but the lack of discretion made me feel so bad for the people who fell victim to this service. do people really want others in line to know the details of their 4-figure hotel bill or whatever else they may (or may not) have ordered? (as someone unwillingly subjected to this conversation, i really didn't have to know what a man ordered for dinner via room service.)  as a country, i found singaporeans unfailingly polite and hospitable. which is why i'm at a complete loss as to why they would be so proud of a place like the marina bay sands. if you need to come here to check off some bucket list, do so with a quick getaway in mind.",

    "review_text" : "remember the last review that i wrote on marina bay sands, i said that the room was spacious and the service was great. this time around, the service couldn't have been more different.we checked-in at 1 pm and a japanese guy named \"phil\" helped us. we booked a garden view-premier room, last time we stayed in a city-view premier room, which is more expensive. we asked phil if the hotel has any rooms with a king bed and a double sized pull-out sofa bed and he quickly checked the computer and told us that they are all booked up. we asked if we can pay extra to get a city-view room that might have a sofa-bed like last time, but he said that there are no more city-view rooms. phil said that he can give us a premier room with a king bed in tower 2 and he would give us a free roll-away bed. the problem started when he provided the keys. phil said that he can only provide us with 2 key cards for free, but there 4 of us. we tried to negotiate with him and informed him that last time we came, we were given 3 keys. phil refused to provide us with 3 keys and we told him to get the manager. so the manager came and her name was etsuko. we explained to her that if the 4 of us are in different places, then 2 of us would not be able to get into our room or even access the lifts to get to the floor. but etsuko seemed like she didn't listen. she then told us in short that giving guests less keys is a way of having less people using the infinity pool, but we paid so much for our room. at some point of the argument, we saw a security staff member walking towards us. they think that we're here to argue, but we just want to stay here and have a good time before we leave singapore. before we left, we told him that, \"we are paying a premium price (us $300+ per night), but we are nor receiving premium service or a premium room.\"the room was much of the same as last time. it was smaller than the room that we stayed in last time since the extra space of the other room is taken by the balcony.given that the service is severely flawed, it isn't worth it to stay here anymore. this hotel is definitely beyond overpriced. the prices for the rooms should be reduced to at least 50%. we could've easily stayed at the fairmont (i have a review on that) or four seasons for much less and gotten better service.",

    "review_text" : "marina bay sands is probably the top 5* hotel in singapore at the moment. the attractions are obvious. say hello to the unparalleled and unobstructed view of the civic district at more. the casino is also way more posh than their counterpart resorts world singapore. just compare the facade and you know that the classy glass exterior beats that tacky colored buildings at sentosa hands down. the congregation of most luxury brands is ideal for shopaholics and tourists alike. spend hours wandering in the airy space and take in the smell of opulence and decadence. from dining at celebrity restaurants to watching world class plays and chilling out at the top of singapore by the infinity pool, marina bay sands has it all.i would say that the location is a little out of the way even though the mrt circle line is right at its doorsteps. the problem is that it's so huge it takes forever to get from the hotel side to the shoppes end. the rooms are big but not particularly fantastic. holiday inn is comparable to it if it were bigger. more could be done to the balcony to make it more of a 'living space' for its really dreary right now. love the place on the whole, not so much the hotel stay. it's jammed packed with chinese tourists who are there to gamble. if you want something more classy, i'd say go for fullerton or fullerton bay hotel.",

    "review_text" : "first time staying at the hotel, went to ku de ta once before when visiting singapore.  this time we came with my son (2 years).located in a convenient place to sightsee and shop.  didn't go to casino because i was with a singaporean and it costs $100.00 to enter, we didn't have enough time to make it worthwhile.the pool/jacuzzi-main reason to stay therethe infinity pool at the skypark was very cool.  we got there early and no problem finding seats.  enjoyed the view, the seats were nice, a jacuzzi that had strong jets and hot, was so welcomed in the evening (it wasn't too hot in singapore for the heat believe it or not)however, felt like a criminal trying to enter the pool, was a  hassle to bring the skypark pool white card to exchange for the wristband, i forgot it once, was dressed up and wanted to get to dinner crossing the pool, security berated us and told us to go around.  i guess it keeps non guests out but they shouldn't make those who paid big money to be there also feel unwanted.  we had our room key, can't they just swipe it?the room, pretty standard, it was ok, huge balcony, but overlooked freeway so if door was open way too noisy.  nice bathroom, loved the shower, tub combo area but it did make the place wet all day.  no place to hang wet bathing suits so no other option but to lay them outside on balcony.i'm pretty much over minibars that don't allow you to refrigerate your own drinks.  why not just let us have a refrigerator?  traveling with children it's a must.  we threw away numerous bottles of formula that could have been saved.  stayed as rasa sentosa the next night, they had an open fridge pre stocked with complimentary beverages!dinner at ku de ta-wonderful atmosphere, prices felt extreme to me but to singaporeans quite normal for that caliber.  tapas style food which i enjoy.  most of it was great.  duck was inedible but when we complained they took it back and brought us something else (no compensation like you expect in the us but that's fine, they did it swiftly and nicely without argument which is all that matters).the fuse lounge-disappointing. had a babysitter, looking forward to an after dinner drink with some music but not a club.  band was horrible, took 45 minutes to \"sound check\" at 9pm while we all sat there.  can't they do that before the lounge opens?  after all that starting and stopping, didn't sound great anyway :) we left disappointed.  would have stayed for another drink or two if music had been nicer.  breakfast buffet-was terrible for the price, do not recommend it unless it's included in your stay, don't pay extra for it!.  they shut down breakfast promptly at 11 so i saw a few of us trying to enjoy \"brunch\" get pressured out, so if you go try to get there early so it's worth it. selections ok, not spectacular as i expected it to be.  american food wasn't good, watery eggs, etc.  the other selections weren't fantastic.  it was just ok, i had better at ksl resort in malaysia ($60 per night eq.) later that week and that buffet was free with room.probably will go back though, can't beat the pool, coolest on the planet.  awesome pictures to make your friends jealous.",

    "review_text" : "marina bay is probably one of the biggest, if not the trademark, tourist attraction in singapore. the incredibly modern and beautiful architecture of the submarine-like infinity pool, passing through three towers of countless luxurious rooms, has become one of the defining landmarks of today's singapore. the room was comfy, large, nice - but didn't quite live up to the grandiosity of the rest of the hotel. even so, i thoroughly enjoyed my stay, and a huge upside was the gorgeous view of gardens by the bay, especially at night when those ginormous trees light up and start flashing. the pool's an absolute must - both during the day and at night. it's a thrill in itself to look over the edge, and the view from the top is absolutely breathtaking. and as expected, it's so incredibly high; the sun essentially sits a few kilometers away from the water. i exaggerate but get ready to roast, a good kinda roast. overall, an amazing and one-of-a-kind experience. again, the rooms are great, but personally i think the hype revolves more around the amenities.the light show at night is quite the spectacle, visible from afar, and then right in front of the shoppes is a water show, during which broad fountains of water jump up and down as they serve as a canvas for moving images and splashes of bright colors. this is a little poorly explained, but i was actually a little confused myself during the show. another plus is the fact that the hotel is connected to the shoppes at marina bay. filled with high end designers (including an outdoor floating louis vuitton store... i know right?), several more \"typical\" stores, indoor gondola rides (...i know right??), an ice skating rink, and a food court, the place is an attraction in itself. i didn't have time to explore and experience everything, but i imagine it would take a long time and i'd never get bored. note: singapore food courts are nothing like the ones in the states, where they're rampant with panda express's and taco bell's. i love general tso and soft taco supremes, but hearty fish ball soup and saucy char kway teow beat all.   as for nightlife, i can't speak for the more popular clubs like pangaea surrounding the hotel, but dom, which was actually within the shoppes itself, was pretty fun! on the smaller side, veryyyyyy dark inside, antique mirrors, an eclectic setup of grand velvet couches and chairs, house beats, a female dj - woohoo!, long bathroom lines - all in all, a good time. (100x better than kyo - but i guess that's not saying much because my night at kyo was meh.) marina bay is an absolute must when in singapore; it's everything you expect, and much much more.",

    "review_text" : "i swear this is not me being patriotic, but marina bay sands hotel has to be the hotel with one of the the best views i have ever seen. hotel rooms are large, spacious and clean - which i find is not a plus point but an expectation as the hotel is relatively new. however the view is to-die-for. mbs hotels have 2 corridors of hotels facing opposite directions, one facing outwards to the marina bay area, and the other facing in land overlooking the cbd area. housekeeping and concierge service is impeccable with a huge array of personal hygiene and luxury items that are brought up to your door with just a phone call. we were offered bubble bath for our tub! do head up to the infinity pool during your stay - both during the day as well as night. the day view on a clear day offers a brilliant blue sky as a backdrop, but the night view is a thousand times more breathtaking! having been to several other cities who claim to have a great city skyline, i have to admit, the one perk of living in such a jam-packed city is the compact and unbroken sky line of city lights our cbd area offers. i've never seen such a view despite being a native living here for the 23 years of my life! mbs even offers a small concierge/valet desk outside the lobby that handles delivery orders, which i find especially endearing since most hotel staff are generally disdainful of guests ordering in fast food delivery in the middle of the night! despite the pricey rack rates, i would definitely recommend mbs as an ideal place to book a room for special occasions such as anniversaries, birthday parties or even hen nights!",

    "review_text" : "truly a gorgeous and superbly amenitized hotel - overpriced in my opinion (i think the cheapest rooms are like $500 singapore dollars a night), but hey, i wasn't paying for it. we were in town in february visiting my mom's side of the family and we typically stay with family, but my grandma is a member of the casino here so she likes to stay at the hotel a couple of times a month and she got us a room as well. this was my boyfriend's first time to accompany me to singapore, and i really think marina bay sands gave him an amazing and lasting impression as to some of the nicer things singapore could offer. the infinity pool is one of the best ones i've ever been towe had a valentine's dinner at the sky on (insert the number floor it's on here.. it's escaping me at the moment) restaurant and the food was delicious. we also met one of my friends from college who was extremely randomly backpacking around europe and asia solo at the time and just happened to be in s'pore at the same time as us up at the bar at ku de ta for drinks. stunning view, but super windy and obviously expensive drinks - but alcohol as a whole in singapore is pricey to me so tomato, to-mah-to.the casino was definitely one of my favorite parts as well - it costs $100 for locals to enter for a period of 24 hours, but is free for any type of foreign passport so we got to enjoy in and out privileges. i never, ever win at casinos, but with the powers of my precious grandma, bf, uncle and myself we miraculously hit a $3000 jackpot on the literal first machine we tried. overall not an experience i'll forget anytime soon and looking forward to many more visits in the future (hopefully still...never..paid..for..by me. :)",

    "review_text" : "the cancellation policy is insane. you can cancel but you surrender 1 night of your reservation - in this case i was only staying 1 night so i would have forfeited the cost of my night to cancel. in addition - if you are a no show then you would lose 1 night plus an additional fee of 1 night. so if i was a no-show then i would have to pay an additioinal night to not go? wtf? i stayed here just for one night during my short stay in singapore. the other nights i was at grand hyatt singapore. seriously i only stayed here because of the infinity pool primarily, and secondarily the casino for my husband. the infinity pool is amazing and everything - even better when there aren't hoards of children / families there and i happened to wander in on a thursday so that was nice. unfortunately the weather was horrendous and thunderstormed/rained pretty much all day so the pool experience was cut short. we weren't any sort of casino member yet either so we got a room in tower 3 which was just fine - overlooking the gardens by the bay on a pretty high floor. i believe tower 1 & 2 are suites or some form of an upgraded room. the amenities in the room/size of the room were decent but for the rate that i paid ~$350 sgd i expected a bit more. i would assume a weekend rate is even more pricier - i arrived around 11am and took my chances to check in early, no room available told me to come back at 1pm but we did luggage drop so that was fine. the shopping here is nice but real fancy - the nightly water show is pretty lame (sorry not sorry). once in a lifetime is all i needed at this property. the luggage/check in reps were friendly but the store reps in the mall all need an attitude check. good riddance!",

    "review_text" : "this is a combined review for the mbs complex which includes the hotel as well as the outlets for shopping and dining as well as the casino and general entertainment.on the hotel side i found the mbs having some deficits in terms of service and in particular the outrageous lineups are a pet peeve of mine. also bear in mind, there is a view towards the rear sea & botanical garden. by far not all (50% only to be precise) rooms have a sg skyline & marina bay view. for the rest your sol. on a positive note, the prices have come down a little and the location is, depending on what you plan to do in the city, still pretty good.living in the city i book hotels for weekend leisure stays. so the mbs saves me the way home from 5* dining options and clubbing at night (see review: pangaea).all of these outlets plus a casino and mall are under the mbs roof so there is plenty to do and it is super convenient. the mbs casino is pretty fun. bring your passport or nid (for locals) and keep in mind as local you have to pay 100$ entry fee (or a whopping 2000$ annually).there is also ku de ta at the skypark. i personally find that place overpriced and not worth going unless you re visiting the first time or take friends out to town. the audience doesn't seem to be very selected either to put it diplomatically. there was a recent uproar with working girls soliciting at the kudeta so that speaks a clear language to probably look for a more upscale place for your nightlife entertainment (note, a high pricetag doesn't always mean class as this example shows).overall though i like the mbs complex due to it's original design and variety of great dining, upscale shopping and entertainment options.pay it a visit and see for yourself!cheers-s",
